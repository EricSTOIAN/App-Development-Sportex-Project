# Sportex App Project ðŸ’ª
<p>Sportex is a recent project I did in collaboration with a few of my classmates, focusing mostly on physical activity. We computer scientists tend to spend a lot of time sat at our desks, coding away at our many projects and sometimes forget that being physically active is incredibly important for the body as well as for the mind.</p>  
## Description
<p>Sportex is an app developped in Kotlin where a user can set goals to achieve while adding workouts to their weekly calendar. Their profile shows their statistics for how many workouts have been completed, the goals reached and their personal details. Being able to modify goals and workouts along the way provide for more
flexibility when it comes to achieving one's goals.</p>
